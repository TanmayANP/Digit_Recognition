# Digit_Recognition
* Build a DL model that best classifies handwritten digits.
* I have used the MNIST dataset and did some data augmentation.
* Used convolutional layers, pooling layers, and TensorFlowâ€™s ImageDataGenerator to reach the accuracy of 99.46% on the test data.  
## Code and Resourses Used
**Python version:** 3.8  
**Packages:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras  
## Data Augmentation
Used ImageDataGenerator class to create on spot new data  
## Model Performance on Test Data
loss = 0.0156
accuracy = 99.52%
